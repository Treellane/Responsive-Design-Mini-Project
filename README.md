# Responsive Design Mini Project

Thsi is the code I have done for the Course section
Responsive Web Design with CSS --> Responsive Design - Mini-Project   

## The goals here... 
This is mainly to:
- 'follow along' with the code
- replicate it
- try to copy/move it to GitHub

... all for the purposes of testing all the above!
